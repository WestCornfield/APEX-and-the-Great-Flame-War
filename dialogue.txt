Ah yes... And I brought along Mark Flynn.
FYI: Y'all's door is unlocked.
If you're not more careful, someone might just slip in here and take your stu-
...
...Whoa.
*bleeding, face covered in glass shards, with a bricked phone embedded in his skull*
ZZZZZzzzzzzzz ZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzz
*drowning in his own bubbling saliva, looking up like a turkey in a rainstorm*
Razza frazza, dangol... *furiously typing into his phone*
...What happened here?
Was APEX attacked, Mark Flynn?
...No. Pretty sure this was...
LARGELY self-inflicted.
Goodness gracious.
...
...
Hey... Jim?
Razza frazza, dangol'... Talkinbout #shutyerface...
It looks like you left the tag belts in this... fishbowl with y'all's keys?
...Mind if we... uh...?
Dangol, gonna kick yer ass up 'n down this message board...
I'll take that as a Yes.
Much obliged.
Gamsa haeyo, Jim Caedus!
We hope one day you return to your former glory and...
Um...
Stop doing this.
Dangol, I'll show y'all I ain't tah be trifled with...
*post sound*
haha, got 'im
*door closes*
Mark Flynn?
Yeah, NK?
Do you hypothesize Jim Caedus will be angry when he realizes we've taken our belts back?
Oh yeah, he'll be good 'n pissed off.
But, I figure he won't find out right away.
We have until people start being polite on the internet...
Or until Jimbo realizes he can just block people he doesn't like.
So... Either way...
Never?
Haha, yeah.
